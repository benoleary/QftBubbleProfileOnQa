# QftBubbleProfileOnQa

A Python program to calculate the profile of the critical bubble for a false
vacuum in a quantum field theory, using a quantum annealer


# Usage

In order to run this, you need to have the Ocean SDK from D-Wave installed.
You also need to have a D-Wave Leap account for submitting jobs to their
quantum annealers if you want to try it out on an actual quantum computer,
rather than using classical annealing or the other local options.
